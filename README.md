British Airways Forage Data Science project

This British Airways project is hosted by Forage. In this project, I leveraged python web scraping techniques from BeautifulSoup and harnessed the power of natural language processing with NLTK to extract valuable insights from online reviews about British Airways. My goal was to identify specific aspects of British Airways travel that resonated positively and negatively with customers based on sentiments in customer feedback and online reviews, before translating them into insightful visualizations.

In the second part of the project, I analysed a large dataset of historical customer booking details, containing information on destinations, passenger counts, booking origins, amenities preferences, and the crucial factor of whether the booking was successfully completed. Employing a Random Forest classification model, I was able to unveil the key determinants among these features that wielded the most significant influence on predictive outcomes.

You will find a quick paper I wrote up to summarise my process for the latter part of the project :)
